Inglourious Basterds is a Quentin Tarantino film set in Nazi-occupied France
during World War II. The movie follows two storylines: one involving a group
of Jewish-American soldiers known as the "Basterds," led by Lieutenant Aldo
Raine, who are on a mission to kill as many Nazis as possible, and another
involving a young French Jewish woman, Shosanna Dreyfus, who seeks revenge
against the Nazis who killed her family.

The two storylines intersect at a film premiere where many of the top
Nazi officials will be in attendance, and the Basterds and Shosanna
plan to launch a coordinated attack. The tension builds as the Basterds
work to infiltrate the event and carry out their mission while Shosanna
prepares to enact her own plan.
